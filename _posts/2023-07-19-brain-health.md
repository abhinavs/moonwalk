## [Avoid head injuries](#avoid-head-injuries)

Although the human brain is the best-protected organ in the human body, the brain’s softness makes it vulnerable to damage from contact with the skull’s interior and compression. [1]. Thus, even mild head injuries increase the risk of cognitive decline or dementia years after the original head injury [2].


## [Improve your sleep hygiene](#get-in-touch-with-your-circadian-rhythm)

The biggest cues are light and noise. Our body is naturally programmed to sleep in darkness and silence, whereas to stay awake when it's bright and noisy.

Tips:
-   Go outside for 10 minutes after you wake up.
-   Aim for a minimum of seven hours of sleep regularly
-   Stop drinking caffeine four to six hours before bed
-   If you need a nap and you are not sleep deprived, keep it short — the best nap length for adults is about 20 minutes and no longer than 30 minutes - so it doesn't affect your next sleep session
-   Stop using tablets one hour before bedtime.
-   Drink one glass of water one hour before bedtime.
-   Consider trying static stretching exercises before bedtime.
  

## [Follow a plant-rich diet](#Follow-a-plant-rich-diet)

Specific nutrients in food - such as omega-3 fatty acids, flavonoids, vitamins B, D, and E, and choline - have been associated with improved cognitive function in older people. Examples of dietary patterns that are rich in these nutrients and have repeatedly shown positive effects on health are DASH, Mediterranean, and MIND diets []. 

(For more information about evidence-based nutrition patterns, you can read a separate article on this topic).


## [Excercise regularly](#excercice-regularly)

Aerobic exercises 
Anaerobic exercises 
Stretching exercises

Aerobic exercises, including jogging, swimming, cycling, walking, gardening, and dancing, have been proven to reduce anxiety and depression,
as well as boost self-esteem and sleep quality. Whereas anaerobic exercises help increase muscle mass and strength. Moreover, a small amount of weight exercise triggers molecular processes which lead to the formation of new neurons and increased synaptic plasticity

Research shows that physical activity reduces the risk of developing many chronic conditions, clinical depression, and dementia, as well as

## [Prevent blood vessel damage](#Prevent-blood-vessel-damage)

By adulthood, the human body on average contains about 100 000 kilometers of blood vessels. The overall condition of these blood vessels is critical not only for maintaining heart health but also for maintaining the viability of any other organ in the human body.

Tips:
-   Try massage therapy - it can have a beneficial impact on circulation - at least in the short-term.
-   Control blood pressure
-   Control blood sugar
