Brain health refers to the preservation of brain integrity and cognitive function. Because brain health does not depend on a single factor, the multi-model approach to maintaining brain health is proposed.

## [Avoid head injuries](#avoid-head-injuries)

Although the human brain is the best-protected organ in the human body, the brain’s softness makes it vulnerable to damage from contact with the skull’s interior and compression. [1]. Thus, even mild head injuries increase the risk of cognitive decline or dementia years after the original head injury [2].


## [Get in touch with your circadian rhythm](#get-in-touch-with-your-circadian-rhythm)

The biggest cue is light. Our body is naturally programmed to sleep in darkness and stay awake when it's bright outside.

Tips:
-   Go outside for 10 minutes after you wake up.
-   Aim for a minimum of seven hours of sleep regularly
-   Stop drinking caffeine four to six hours before bed
-   If you need a nap and you are not sleep deprived, keep it short — the best nap length for adults is about 20 minutes and no longer than 30 minutes - so it doesn't affect your next sleep session
-   Stop using tablets one hour before bedtime.
-   Consider trying static stretching exercises before bedtime.
  

## [Follow a plant-rich diet](#[Follow-Mediterranean-diet)

Specific nutrients in food - such as omega-3 fatty acids, flavonoids, vitamins B, D, and E, and choline - have been associated with improved cognitive function in older people. Examples of dietary patterns that are rich in these nutrients and have repeatedly shown positive effects on health are Mediterranean and MIND diets []. 

(For more information about evidence-based nutrition patterns, you can read a separate article on this topic).


## [Excercise regularly](#excercice-regularly)

Physical activity has many known benefits. In particular, it benefits cognitive function.


## [Stay mentally active](#the-middle)




## [Prevent and treat blood vessel damage](#the-middle)

By adulthood, the human body on average contains about 100 000 kilometers of blood vessels. The condition of these blood vessels is critical not only for maintaining heart health but also for any other organ in the human body.

also plays a critical role in maintaining brain health.


## [Stay socially engaged](#the-middle)

Social interaction helps ward off depression and stress.


## Follow lifestyle habits for mental health

-   Consider getting a personal "Not to-do list".
