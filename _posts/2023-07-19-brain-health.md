## [Avoid head injuries](#avoid-head-injuries)

Although the human brain is the best-protected organ in the human body, the brain’s softness makes it vulnerable to damage from contact with the skull’s interior and compression. [1]. Thus, even mild head injuries increase the risk of cognitive decline or dementia years after the original head injury [2].


## [Get in touch with your circadian rhythm](#get-in-touch-with-your-circadian-rhythm)

The biggest cue is light. Our body is naturally programmed to sleep in darkness and stay awake when it's bright outside.
Below we provide a list of tips that may improve the quality of your sleep:
-   Go outside for 10 minutes after you wake up.
-   Aim for a minimum of seven hours of sleep on a regular basis
-   Stop drinking caffeine four to six hours before bed
-   Stop using tablets one hour before bedtime.
-   Consider trying static stretching exercises before bedtime.
  

## [Diet](#diet)

Consider following a Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes whole grains, plant-based foods, fish, and olive oil.


## [Excercise regularly](#excercice-regularly)
