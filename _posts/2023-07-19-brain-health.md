Brain health refers to the preservation of brain integrity and cognitive function. Because brain health does not depend on a single factor, the multi-model approach to maintaining brain health is proposed.

## [Avoid head injuries](#avoid-head-injuries)

Although the human brain is the best-protected organ in the human body, the brain’s softness makes it vulnerable to damage from contact with the skull’s interior and compression. [1]. Thus, even mild traumatic brain injuries increase the risk of cognitive decline or dementia years after the original brain injury [2].


## [Improve your sleep hygiene](#get-in-touch-with-your-circadian-rhythm)

The biggest cues are light and noise. Our body is naturally programmed to sleep in darkness and silence, whereas to stay awake when it's bright and noisy.

Tips:
-   Go outside for 10 minutes after you wake up.
-   Aim for a minimum of seven hours of sleep regularly
-   Stop drinking caffeine four to six hours before bed
-   If you need a nap and you are not sleep deprived, keep it short — the best nap length for adults is about 20 minutes and no longer than 30 minutes - so it doesn't affect your next sleep session
-   Stop using tablets one hour before bedtime.
-   Drink one glass of water one hour before bedtime.
-   Consider trying static stretching exercises before bedtime.
  

## [Follow a plant-rich diet](#Follow-a-plant-rich-diet)

Specific nutrients in food - such as omega-3 fatty acids, flavonoids, vitamins B, D, and E, and choline - have been associated with improved cognitive function in older people. Examples of dietary patterns that are rich in these nutrients and have repeatedly shown positive effects on health are DASH, Mediterranean, and MIND diets []. 

(For more information about evidence-based nutrition patterns, you can read a separate article on this topic).


## [Excercise regularly](#excercice-regularly)

The physically inactive males between the ages of 25 and 60 experience a gradual decline in both muscle mass and strength, with a loss rate of 0.5 percent per year. Once men reach the age of 60, the rate of muscle loss doubles to approximately 1 percent per year. Aerobic exercises, including jogging, swimming, cycling, walking, and dancing, along with stretching exercises, have been shown to reduce anxiety and depression, as well as boost self-esteem and sleep quality. Whereas anaerobic exercises help increase muscle mass and strength. Importantly, all three types of physical activity trigger molecular processes, which lead to the formation of new neurons and increased synaptic plasticity.

## [Prevent blood vessel damage](#Prevent-blood-vessel-damage)

By adulthood, the human body on average contains about 100 000 kilometers of blood vessels. The overall condition of these blood vessels is critical not only for maintaining heart health but also for maintaining the viability of any other organ in the human body.

Tips:
-   Try massage therapy - it can have a beneficial impact on circulation - at least in the short-term.
-   Control blood pressure. If your blood pressure has been stable for a long time, you might only need to measure it once every 4 to 6 months.
-   Control blood sugar. For most people without diabetes or pancreatic diseases, blood sugar testing is recommended once a year.


## [Stay socially engaged](#the-middle)

In terms of effects on the brain, building social networks and participating in social activities are similar to physical exercise, because they lead to the formation of new neural connections, stimulate attention and memory, in conjunction with helping ward off depression and stress. On the contrary, both social isolation and loneliness are significantly associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01617-6].  Non-stressful interpersonal relationships



## Follow lifestyle habits for mental health

-   Think about getting a personal "Not to-do list".

## Consider living in the natural environment (#consider-middle)

Living in a rural area has a list of benefits. For example, compared to urban areas, it is associated with a lower risk for mental disorders such as anxiety disorders, depression [
