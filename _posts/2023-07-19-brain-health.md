Brain health refers to the preservation of brain integrity and cognitive function. Because brain health does not depend on a single factor, below we propose a multi-model approach to maintaining brain health.

## [Avoid head injuries](#avoid-head-injuries)

The brain's softness makes it vulnerable to damage from contact with the skull's interior and compression [1]. Thus, even mild head injuries increase the risk of cognitive decline or dementia years after the original head injury [2]. Moreover, more head injuries are associated with a greater risk of dementia [2].


## [Get in touch with your circadian rhythm](#get-in-touch-with-your-circadian-rhythm)

The biggest cue is light. Our body is naturally programmed to sleep in darkness and stay awake when it's bright outside.
Below we provide a list of tips that may improve the quality of your sleep:
•   Aim for a minimum of seven hours of sleep on a regular basis
•   Stop drinking caffeine four to six hours before bed
•   Stop using tablets one hour before bedtime.
•   Consider trying static stretching exercises before bedtime.

## [Diet](#diet)

Consider following a Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes whole grains, plant-based foods, fish, and olive oil.


## [Excercise regularly](#excercice-regularly)

Exercise has many known benefits. In particular, physical activity benefits cognitive function.


# [Stay mentally active](#the-middle)

Your brain is similar to a muscle — you need to use it or lose it


## Blood vessels(#the-middle)

The health of your arteries and veins is essential to your heart health but it is also critical for brain health.


## Stay socially engaged(#the-middle)

Social interaction helps ward off depression and stress.
